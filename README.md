# Basic Overview of SQL (Structed Query Language) and other Databases
SQL is a language used to communicate with databases. It helps you perform CRUD operations on a database.

Types of Databases

1. Relational Database (RDBMS): It stores data in tables (rows and columns), and the tables can be connected to each other. <br> ***Examples include*** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.

2. NoSQL Database: NoSQL doesn’t mean “no schema”; it actually means “not only SQL.” This means you can define a strict schema when needed, similar to SQL databases, or use a schemaless structure if flexibility is required.

   ### Types include:
   - Document-based (JSON-like documents) <br>
   - Key-value (data stored as key–value pairs)
   - Column-based (data stored in columns)
   - Graph-based (data stored as nodes and relationships)
   - Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra.

3. Cloud Databases: These are databases that run on the cloud instead of your local computer. They are easy to scale and manage, and many features are already pre-configured. We mainly manage them by using commands or settings. <br>
***Examples include*** Firebase, Amazon RDS, and Google Cloud SQL.

4. Distributed Databases: Data is stored across multiple computers/locations, but works like one database. It helps in reliability and speed.

5. Object-Oriented Databases: Stores data in the form of objects (like in object-oriented programming). Useful for complex data structures.

6. Hierarchical Databases: Data is arranged like a tree structure (parent–child form).<br>
***Example:*** old IBM databases.

7. Network Databases: Similar to hierarchical databases but allows multiple parent-child relationships.
